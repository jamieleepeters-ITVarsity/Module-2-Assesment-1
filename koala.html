                           <p>Koala Profile
Koalas are unique animals native to Australia where they are the only extant (living) species of their family. While their closest living relative is the wombat, it’s not the same – nor is it a bear despite the misnomer “koala bear”.

Koalas are their own, individual species with many special quirks and facts that have made them one of the more popular animals in the world.
