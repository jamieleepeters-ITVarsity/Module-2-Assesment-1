Portrait of a Howler Monkey
Monkeys, gibbons and apes are all primates, but belong in different families. The most obvious difference between monkeys and apes is that apes do not have tails. 


A few isolated monkey species do not have tails either, but they are the exception rather than the rule.

The great apes, which are the human being, the orangutan, the gorilla, the chimpanzee and the bonobo, are much larger than monkeys and much more highly evolved.

The gibbon, which has many aspects of both monkeys and apes, is truly its own separate creature, although it is often lumped in with either apes or monkeys by virtue of many different arguments, both scientific and not so scientific.

We have separated the gibbons and offer their own article. We have also separated the baboon into it's own page because it is so well known, but the baboon is in fact an Old World monkey with the customary large size and non-prehensile tail..

Monkeys are highly intelligent and active primates that are broken into two groups known as Old World monkeys and New World monkeys.

The Old World monkeys (including baboons) inhabit Africa and Asia, and are more closely related to apes. They are generally larger than New World monkeys, have more elongated faces, and have a tail that is not "prehensile".

New world monkeys are five families of primates that inhabit Central America, South America and some parts of Mexico. New world monkeys are generally smaller, have more flattened faces and have "prehensile tails" which they are capable of gripping with.

The prehensile tail is slim, muscular and very long, usually longer than the body length, and can easily support the weight of the entire monkey. These tails often have a patch of bare rough skin called a tactile pad or friction pad, that helps in grasping objects.

While the tail is used primarily to assist in climbing and keeping the hands free for foraging and carrying, some monkey species will use it almost as an extra hand to hold and manipulate food items.

New world monkeys often use their tails to grab each other during wrestling and play, and will wrap their tails around each her for comfort.</p>
